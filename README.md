# Angular-Webservices

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.2.

## Using the NewsAPI
We used the NewsAPI in this project just to know how to work with API in a project and how to interact with them in a proper manner

## Requirements 
- You need to work with [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org) register and get an API Key.
- Then go to **src/app/newsapi.service.ts** and make a change in ```api_key = 'Insert the API you get after registration'```
